The webpage is hosted on GitHub Pages and contains the date the document was created and the map created with Leaflet. 
  
``````{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
Moscow = data.frame(
        lat = c(55.716939, 55.691242),
        lng = c(37.595078, 37.660278),
        labels = c("My home", "My work")
)
my_map <- leaflet(Moscow) %>% 
              addTiles %>% 
              addPopups(popup=~labels)
my_map
